# 🚀 DevOps Portfolio – Real-World Infrastructure Projects

Welcome to my **DevOps Portfolio**, where I showcase a curated collection of **production-grade, real-world infrastructure projects** built using AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, and modern DevOps tools.

> 💼 These projects reflect how real companies deploy, scale, monitor, and secure cloud infrastructure.
